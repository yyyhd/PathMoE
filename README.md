# PathMoE

Neoadjuvant therapy efficacy assessment is critical for prognostic evaluation and clinical decision-making in locally advanced breast cancer. This study developed an AI-based pathological multistain mixture-of-expert model, PathMoE, to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using pre-treatment breast biopsy whole slide images (WSIs) from multistain (H\&E, ER, PR, HER2, and Ki-67). Leveraging Virchow2, a large-scale pathology foundation model, we extracted generalizable WSI representations and integrated them through a multi-instance, expert-gated fusion strategy. PathMoE was trained and tested on 12,150 WSIs from 2,430 patients across five medical centers. Across independent external cohorts and a prospective cohort, analyses consistently demonstrated that PathMoE achieved robust pCR prediction, with added potential to predict response to combined neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NACI). PathMoE enabled robust risk stratification and served as an independent prognostic indicator. Model attention maps highlighted anti-tumor immune cell patterns as key decision drivers, while RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) linked high PathMoE scores to immune-related pathways. Collectively, these findings suggest that PathMoE is a promising tool for predicting pCR to NAC  and personalized management in breast cancer.
